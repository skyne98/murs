# Attributes
## Overview
- Dexterity (__DEX__)
- Strength (__STR__)
- Intelligence (__IQ__)
- Fitness (__FIT__)

Attribute checks are the base __all game mechanics__. Whenever the character is trying to do something in a limited amount of time, or something which might have serious consequences for the character - an attribute check has to be made.\
GM (_Game Master_) can use attributes and attribute checks as the only mechanic in their campaign, relying on them for resolving conflicts and growing characters, however, we strongly recommend to follow the complete set of rules (_including things like skills, carrying capacity, armor, etc_).

### Dexterity
A measure of the character's physical agility, coordination, and manual dexterity. Whenever the character wants to do something acrobatic (_like swinging on a branch or doing a backflip_) they need to make a __DEX__ check.\
__DEX__ checks are also used when the character is trying to aim or avoid an incoming attack. 

### Strength
A measure of the character's physical power and bulk, ability to lift, carry, and deal damage. __STR__ checks apply in situations when the character needs to perform an activity requiring pure physical strength (_like pulling themselves up, moving something heavy, etc_).\
In some scenarios your __STR__ can influence the outcome of an action. For example, while using a melee weapon, after landing a hit the amount of brute-force damage will depend on the character's __STR__.

### Intelligence
A measure of the character's ability to learn, to understand or to deal with new or trying situations; ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly. Checks against __INT__ have to be made whenever the character is trying to reason about something, make a rational decision, invent something or find a solution to a problem.\
In some campaigns character's __INT__ can influence the power of their magic spells, or level of tech they can try to operate (_a knight finding a gun_).

### Fitness
A measure of the character's health and overall ability to withhold damage, poison, illnesses and other harmful effects.
