# Rolls
## Overview
- MURS uses six-sided dice (d6), usually 3d6 are used for checks
- With a DR (_Difficulty Rating_) of 10, you need to roll 10 or less to succeed
- Usually, DR is equal to character's attribute
- Positive modifiers decrease your roll, while negative ones increase it
- Rolls of __3__ or __4__ are critical successes, while __17__ or __18__ are critical failures
- Any roll which is __DR__+10 is an automatic critical failure

Just as an example, let's imagine that the character has __DEX__ of 12. This character wants to jump over a high fence (_+4_). Fortunately, this character has some additional skills or equipment providing him additional __-2__ to his check. To succeed in jumping over the fence the character must make a __DEX__+4 check, that means that they will have to roll against their __DEX__, while adding __4__ to their roll as a negative modifier and subtracting __2__ as a positive one. As the result, only rolls of __10__ (_10+4-2=12 = DR of 12_) or less will be __successful__.
